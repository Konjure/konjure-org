							<h3 class="no-select">What is Konjure?</h3>
							<div class="expander-content">
								<br>
								<p>Konjure is a new type of website builder for the Decentralized Web. Our goal is to streamline the process for site creation, whether that be a blog, shop, or personal website, to hosting on a peer-to-peer network.</p>

							<h3 class="no-select">What is the KONJ token?</h3>
							<div class="expander-content">
								<br>
								<p>KONJ is our utility token for use inside the Konjure ecosystem. Users can browse shops, purchase plugins on our Bazaar, unlock new features for their website, and much more.</p>
							</div>

							<i class="fa fa-angle-down"></i>
							<h3 class="no-select">How can I obtain KONJ?</h3>
							<div class="expander-content">
								<br>
								<p>After our primary token sale in Q1 2019, KONJ will be listed on various exchanges and available to purchase. After our public beta launches in 2020, users will be able to purchase KONJ directly from our platform.</p>

							<h3 class="no-select">What sets you apart from other website builders?</h3>
							<div class="expander-content">
								<br>
								<p>By taking advantage of the various new decentralized web projects being funded, we will deploy websites directly onto a peer-to-peer network in just a few clicks. Compared to centralized hosting, websites will be cheaper, faster, censorship-resistant, and more secure. Striving to be a truly decentralized project in the future, not even Konjure will have the ability to modify your website. Instead, we will have community-based systems in place such as flagging websites.</p>
								<br>
								<p>The second primary innovation we're making is our website generation technology. We're throwing out themes and templates, and replacing them with procedurally generated designs based on your input. This way, you will have a completely unique website to start from that has never been seen before.</p>

							<i class="fa fa-angle-down"></i>
							<h3 class="no-select">What is the Bazaar?</h3>
							<div class="expander-content">
								<br>
								<p>Konjure's Bazaar is a marketplace where developers can sell plugins. These are features that are not included in the website builder by default. Premium (paid) plugins are purchased using KONJ.</p>

							<h3 class="no-select">Why create Konjure LLC in Wyoming?</h3>
							<div class="expander-content">
								<br>
								<p>As a team based in the United States, we decided that a Limited Liability Company registered in the most cryptocurrency-friendly state would be ideal. As we progress through our token sale, we will be establishing The Konjure Foundation in Switzerland, where the development of our website builder will take place.</p>

							<h3 class="no-select">What type of websites will be able to be created?</h3>
							<div class="expander-content">
								<br>
								<p>With our plugin marketplace, the possibilities for what types of websites you'll be able to create in the future are endless. At launch, Konjure will create features specifically for shops, blogs, and personal websites.</p>

							<h3 class="no-select">When will I be able to create a website?</h3>
							<div class="expander-content">
								<br>
								<p>Konjure is a large-scale project, but we're looking to have a public beta available towards the end of 2020.</p>
							</div>
						</div>

							<i class="fa fa-angle-down"></i>
							<h3 class="no-select">How will websites be generated?</h3>
							<div class="expander-content">
								<br>
								<p>Our first stage of development is Konjure UI, a user-interface framework that our websites are built with. When creating a website, Konjure will ask for information such as your industry, color scheme, preferred style, and much more. This teaches our machine learning technology about your project and lets it tailor a design specifically for you.</p>
								<br>
								<p>Once you're satisfied with your starting point, you'll be able to modify your website further with simple drag and drop functionality.</p>

							<h3 class="no-select">How many KONJ tokens are there?</h3>
							<div class="expander-content">
								<br>
								<p>On launch, <strong>750,000,000</strong> KONJ tokens were created, and as our max supply, there will never be more than that amount. KONJ cannot be mined.</p>

							<h3 class="no-select">How will you deal with fraudulent or illegal websites?</h3>
							<div class="expander-content">
								<br>
								<p>Creating a truly decentralized ecosystem comes with challenges. Since we won't have the ability to delete websites in the future, we will give our community the tools, such as website flagging, to keep users safe. We will elaborate on these features as development progresses.</p>
